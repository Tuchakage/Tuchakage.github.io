              <h2 class = "normal">Creating Cutscenes</h2>
              <p>The storyboard for the narrative intro has finally been completed so it is now time to get started on one of my roles which is being the Cinematic programmer. Since its been a while since i first tried out the cinematic in Unreal when the guest speaker came in and taught us how to use it, i had to go over hit powerpoints again and go to the test project i used.</p>
              <p>Creating the cutscenes wasn't really hard, its like editing a video using Davinci Resolve or Premier Pro but with extra steps such as having to drag in the character models into the scene and adjusting what animations. Thanks to the storyboards made by the Narrative Designer it was extremely easy to create the cutscenes for the intro of the game. After the scene for the narrative intro the storyboard for the Level 1 intro was ready so i was able to create some shots from that.</p>
              <p>In preparation for the map of Level 2 of our game i added in a Factory Map asset that i had in my Unreal library, only problem i had with importing this was that since it was over 2GB in order to push it to the Git repositry i had to separate out the assets and then push it which took a while to do. I also spent some time helping one of the gameplay programmers with how to make the player character on the Unreal engine and i told the 2nd gameplay programmer that they should add a navmesh to the maps that are currently in our game so that enemy ai and the player can move around in.</p>
