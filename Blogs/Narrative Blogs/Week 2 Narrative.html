              <h2 class = "normal">Coming Up With The First Act</h2>
              <p>We had a few story ideas up on the Trello but they were just brief descriptions of the story, this week we started to have a proper look at the structure of a good story and we created a few characters.</p>
              <p>I decided that we should start elaborating more of our story and start separating them out into different acts just like we were told to do by our lecturer. We first started to elaborate on Story Idea 1 which was my idea where its basically about a boy who discovers his powers but he is afraid to use them.</p>
              <p>As a team we had a long discussions about what would happen in this story whilst looking at the resources that was given to us from our lecturer that showed us how to structure our story. We were able to write down the whole of Act 1 (See "Story Idea 1 So Far" Image down below).</p>

              <h2 class = "normal">Character Design & Part Of Act 2</h2>
              <p>Before we went onto Act 2, we wanted to start thinking about the main character and villains. Long story short we basically made me the hero in this story but my full name is "Tuchan Mikazuchi" with my powers basically being around speed and a hidden power i have which is luck. </p>
              <p>The villain of the story is the name of a friend in our group but their full name is "Alfred Fantasma", at first he seems like a good guy since hes friends with the hero but it turns out that he was bad the whole time (See The Character Profiles For both characters below).</p>
              <p>Now that we had characters, Alfred (the real one) was able to come up with a mid point reversal where his character in the game would reveal himself to me (in game) we were able to write down the Midpoint reversal for Act 2 (See "Story Idea 1 So Far" Image down below)</p>
