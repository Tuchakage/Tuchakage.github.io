              <h2 class = "normal">Im Back....</h2>
              <p>Its been a while but long story short all the previous weeks were just finishing off projects that were due earlier and the narrative directors creating the story in more depth. After finally finishing my FYP and spending a lot of time on projects whos deadlines were soon it was time to get started on actually creating the Narrative game using the Unreal Engine especially since the script for it and the narrative side of things were almost done i decided to help the gameplay programmers out a bit by creating the base for the Enemy Ais.</p>
              
              <h2 class = "normal">Enemy AI (Melee)</h2>
              <p>I first created the Enemy Ai that will deal with melee damage, to get the Ai to track the player, i added the features to sense just incase we needed it but its going to detect the player straight away regardless. To get the Enemy to move to the player i used the Unreal Engines behaviour trees and blackboard, once the player has been sensed (Will automatically sense when spawned) it will rotate, move to the target and then it will call the attack task.  </p>
              <p>The purpose of the attack task is to basically let the Animation blueprint know when to play the attack animation and then from there if the Enemy collides with the player at a certain point of the animation then the DoAttack() function of the Enemy blueprint will be called which will deal damage to the player and knock it back.</p>
              
              <h2 class = "normal">Enemy AI (Ranged)</h2>
              <p>Since the ranged Enemy is derived from the Melee Enemy (Blueprint for Melle enemy is called "BasicEnemyBP" i didnt have to do much all i needed to do was override the DoAttack() to make it spawn an energy blast that when it hits the player will cause knockback and damage.</p>
              <p>One final thing i did this week is that i created branches for each member who will be going on the project, since this allows everyone to be on the project at the same time.</p>
