            <p>
              This week was an extremely busy week so i wasnt able to work on the project as much but even 
              so i was able to fix a big problem in my lobby system which is when a room is created and is then closed because there 
              is no players in it, the room card still appears. I thought the issue was because of the error 
              <b>“InvalidOperationException: Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute” </b> that i mentioned in <a href="..\..\Blogs\Connected Games Blogs\Week 2 Connected .html">Week 2</a>  
              which is an error that is thrown out when i try to modify a list whilst i 
              am looping through that list but after some debugging that line of code that was causing the error was never the issue.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the screenshot above i am showcasing the code that was causing the error meaning that the room card would stay on the 
              screen but this code doesn’t actually remove the UI element, i was able to realise this after looking at the Asteroid Demos code to see how they handled 
              things and broke it down to understand why it worked the way it did. I realised that i never actually destroy the room card game Object so to solve the problem 
              that has been there for a while i simply created a function called ClearRoomListView() that would look at all the room card game objects that is a child of the game 
              object assigned to the roomListParent game object 
              (Game Object that puts the room cards in a vertical layout group) and it will destroy all the children of that game object.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also encountered an issue once where for some reason joining the room failed and the UI for creating the room and the input fields 
              stayed disappeared, this is when i remembered during a lecture the OnJoinRoomFailed PUN callback so i added that along with code to bring the UI back and to reset the 
              joiningRoom variable (Which hasn’t been used but is there for now to locally store whether i have joined a room or not).
