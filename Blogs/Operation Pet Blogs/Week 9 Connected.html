            <p>
              This week we had our presentation where we had to showcase the technical side of our game Project Pet (You may have noticed i keep switching from
               Project Pet to Operation Pet in previous blogs and that is because we haven’t decided on a final name) and i would say it went really well! There were also other very good presentations that gave me some ideas for our game, 
              such as Playfab which is a backend platform a group is using for their game for databases, there was also Photon Fusion that was mentioned which could be something i could switch to if we finish our game early.
            </p>

            <h2 class = "normal">Using Miro for diagrams</h2>


            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image.png" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>For my Diagrams i was changing between Microsoft Visio and Star UML but i wasn’t sure which one i liked out of the 2, Star UML i couldn’t access it through the cloud i had to keep uploading the file through my one drive and Microsoft 
              Visio i could only use on the Universitys computer. I then started to use Microsoft Visio which was a website that one of the designers introduced to me and loved it so i recreated my UML Diagram on there.
            </p>

            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image (2).png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto; width: 50%; text-align: center;">

            <p>
              I started using it to create a flowchart for how i can 
              implement the Pet food spawner such as thinking of a way to initialise the Pet Food Spawner and also the logic for how spawning the food for each team in the game is going to work. <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINtsvgE=/?share_link_id=183813274875">Here is the link to the Miro board.</a>
            </p>

            <h2 class = "normal">Pet Food Spawner</h2>
            <a style="color: blue;" href="https://trello.com/c/8jTtSpKE/72-pet-food-spawner">Pet Food Spawner planning with Trello card</a>

            <p>The Pet Food Spawner is needed so that the correct food type is spawned in depending on the different teams that are in the game, e.g if there is no one in Team cat then the fish food won’t be spawned in. 
              This feature will also handle the amount of food that will be spawned into the 
              game and will also set the food that is spawned in to be fake depending on the ratio of real to fake food, i created a script called PetFoodSpawner which will handle all the logic for spawning in the food.
            </p>

            <h2 class = "normal">Initialisation</h2>
            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image (3).png" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>
              This function is a function called by the ScoreManager script that returns an integer value which keeps hold of the maximum amount of food a team can collect. 
              It does this by getting the amount of spawnpoints in the map then dividing it by the amount of teams in 
              the game (Done by the CountTeams() function) and then divides the sum of that by 2 because 50% of the food in the game will be mines. It will also spawn the food into the game after the calculations are done.
            </p>

            <h2 class = "normal">Spawning the food</h2>
            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image (6).png" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>A crucial function in this script is the SpawnFood() function, which will first make sure that the Master Client is the only one spawning the food in and
               if it is the master client then it will find all the game objects that have the tag spawnpoints and will store it into a temporary list. After that using the list of spawnpoints we will choose a random 
              spawnpoint by passing the list into the ChooseRandomSpawnpoint() function that will choose a random number depending on how big the spawnpoint list is and will remove that spawnpoint from the list and then return it.
            </p>

            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image (5).png" style="width: 100%;">
            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image (4).png" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>So we know what food to spawn in the parameter of the PhotonNetwork.Instantiate where we need to choose a prefab we call the CheckActiveTeams() function which checks 
              through all the teams in the foodSpawnedPerTeam Dictionary which purpose is to make sure each team have an equal amount of food to collect (This is populated by ResetFoodSpawned() called in the Awake() function).
            </p>

            <p>
              In that check it will see if the value is in the dictionary and if the food hasn’t reached the maximum amount of food that can be spawned which is stored in the foodPerTeam variable that is set by the Init() function. 
              If it hasn’t reached the max then it will increase the amount of food to spawn and then depending on the team it is checking it will choose a model to Instantiate.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since it is only the Master Client spawning the food in, the correct food will be spawned for every player in the same position, if everyone was spawning the food then everyone will get different locations for food because of randomising the spawnpoint.
            </p>

            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image (7).png" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>
              Finally the last part of spawning the food in is setting the food that has spawned as a mine after all the other food has been spawned in.
            </p>

            <h2 class = "normal">Round ending after all food collected</h2>
            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image (8).png" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>
              Thanks to the Pet Food Spawner we now know the max amount of food collectibles each team needs to collect, so i modified the IncreaseScore() 
              function where once a food is collected it will check if that was the last food that team had to collect and if it was then the IncreaesTeamRound() function is called from the round manager.
            </p>

            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image (9).png" style="width: 100%;">
            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image (10).png" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>
              The IncreaseTeamRound function is a function that simply updates the amount of rounds a team has won and stores it into the rooms custom property, it will then call the NextRound() function which checks if 
              they are on round 3 or less and if they are then it will increase the Round Number (Which is stored in the rooms custom property) and then it will reload the level. If not then it will call the CheckGameWinner() function.
            </p>

            <h2 class = "normal">CheckGameWinner() Function</h2>
            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image (11).png" style="width: 100%;">
            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 9\image (12).png" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>
              The CheckGameWinner() function is an important function that will check how many rounds each team has won and will add them to a dictionary called possibleWinners but if there is more than 
              one team in this dictionary then it will check if the other teams have a lower score than the current team, 
              if they do then they are removed from this dictionary, if they have the same amount of rounds won then they are still added to the dictionary and later on Deathmatches will be implemented into the game.
            </p>
