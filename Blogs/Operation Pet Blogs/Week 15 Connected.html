                <h2 class = "normal">Creating Network Synced Players</h2>
                <p>
                  This week was the final week before submission and a lot of good progress was made! One of them was creating the Player that works with multiplayer as the other programmer has been focusing on 
                  the player mechanics, i decided to get started with making it be usable in multiplayer since i had finished all my tasks.
                   Since during this whole project i have been working on the system side of the game and previously i mostly made games in the Unreal Engine it was finally time for me to learn about the new Unitys Input System!
                </p>

                <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 15\image.png" style="width: 100%;">
                <p>For the Pet character i created a new Script called Pet Controller that would handle just basic movement, jumping and light attacks, to make it multiplayer compatible so that all the players can control their own 
                  character at the top of the FixedUpdate() function all i needed to do was add the code “if(!photonView.IsMine) return;” which means if i don’t control this photon 
                  Instantiated object then don’t run the rest of the code. The Wizard uses a different script called “FloatingCharacter” created by the other programmer but i also added code to that to make it usable online.
                </p>

                <h2 class = "normal">Unitys Input System</h2>
                <p>
                  The Unity Input system works similar to Unreals Enhanced Input System which allows for easy input management so that an action can be performed by different inputs from different controllers e.g.
                   WSAD keys if the player is using a keyboard but if the player wanted to play with a controller moving with the left stick then they can do that without programmers having to modify the code.
                </p>

                <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 15\image (1).png" style="width: 100%;">
                <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 15\image (2).png" style="width: 100%;">

                <p>
                  I created action maps for Pets and Wizard which essentially manages the control scheme depending on the role that was chosen , this isseparate since they both have different abilities. For action maps you need to subscribe 
                  them to a function in your code for example Pet.Jump.started is subscribed to the Jump( Function and since i chose the “started” property, whenever the button to jump is pressed the Jump() Function is called, this is subscribed when the 
                  Player is spawned in. There is also code to unsubscribe the function from the action map whenever the player is destroyed, unsubscribing action maps can be helpful if something happens in the game where the same controls need to be used
                   differently.
                </p>

                <h2 class = "normal">Final Thoughts On Project</h2>

                <p>
                  The final piece of the puzzle was making playable characters and once we done that we did multiple test runs to find and clean up any problems, after playing game i am very proud of 
                  what we were able to develop and i was having fun playing it!
                </p>

                <p>
                  From this project i learned a lot but the main thing i am happy that improved is my ability to plan code before actually coding such as creating flow diagrams or when creating new features just writing down ideas on how to implement 
                  them on a Trello board. This made it so that when i actually
                   launched up Unity i was able to implement the features quickly, i was also proud of implementing the login system with a database which is something i had never done before and after a lot of research and testing i was able to implement it!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now with that done here is a video put together by our designers to showcase the game!
                </p>
