            <p>This week for the Connected Games Module we formed teams of 5, 3 Designers and 2 Programmers (1 of them being me), for the first week we gave ourselves a week deadline to come up with game ideas and created a Trello board where we can write down anything we were thinking off.
              In the mean time i did the Multiplayer Ping Pong game tutorial that was made by our Professor.</p>
            <h2 class = "normal">What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
              Its been a while since i’ve used Unity since i have mostly been working with Unreal Engine for a long time so i started off with actually getting the ball and pad moving, from this the only thing i needed to learn was how the new Unity Input system works which i was able to figure out thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONlMEZs9Rgw&ab_channel=BiteMeGames">Bite Me Games youtube video</a>. It works similar to the Unreals input system 
              where you can have multiple “Input System” assets that can have different controls for the same action and you change these 
              input systems whilst the game is playing.

              

            </p>

            <p>
              I tried to deviate from the tutorial when it got to the room list part since it created the Room list UI in C# code and i would want to use the normal UI system so that designers have more control over how it looks but i spent a decent amount of time trying to do this using the code from the tutorial in combination with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QilKZ1f5Vo&ab_channel=bananadev2">bananadev2 using it to see how they spawned the room list in.</a> In the end i went back to the tutorial since i realised
               i should probably finish it off before doing my own thing just to get an understanding of everything and i was able to create a multiplayer Ping Pong game!
