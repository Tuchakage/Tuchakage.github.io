            <h2 class = "normal">Whats happened this week?</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>Some studying about Databases and SQL</li>
              <li>Changed PlayerModelScriptableObjects to TeamScriptableObjects and then added food models Mesh array</li>
              <li>Made the PetFood Prefab a single prefab that stores all the meshes to the food model and are set from the TeamScriptableObject</li>
              <li>Players playing as the Pet role can only see food of their team</li>
              <li>Players can see how many rounds each team has won</li>
            </ul>

          


            <h2 class = "normal">Players seeing how many Rounds they won</h2>

            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 11\image (2).png" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>
              Not only could i not see how many rounds teams have won unless i looked in the console, players also had no idea how many rounds they won unless they kept count, because of this i decided to 
              create a function called UpdateRoundWonUI() which is called at the start of the level being loaded as long as the key that holds the value of how many games each team has won has already been set.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this function depending on the team that is being checked the code will look for the spawnLocation of where the round won indicator should be and it will 
              then check the current rooms custom properties to check how many rounds that team has won and will spawn in the amount of indicators accordingly. 
              The indicators are spawned in order thanks to the Horizontal Layout Group Component.
            </p>

            <h2 class = "normal">Database Studying</h2>

            <p>
              I went back to learning more about Databases and SQL since the time for adding a login system is coming closer. In Week 7 i was following a tutorial by my Professor Vasilis which focused more on connecting Unity to the internet. 
              Now i will be following a tutorial by a Youtube channel called Board To Bits Games and he focuses more on creating the login system with a password created using hash and salt.
            </p>

            <h2 class = "normal">Login System</h2>
            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 11\image (3).png" style="width: 100%;">
            
            <h3 class = "normal">Registering</h3>
            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 11\image (4).png" style="width: 100%;">

            <p>
              When registering i also learned about salt and has which prevents hackers breaking through encrypted passwords, to actually create a hash we need to first create a salt and we encrypt the salt and the password by using the crypt() function.
            </p>

            <h3 class = "normal">Logging In</h3>
            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 11\image (5).png" style="width: 100%;">
            <img src="..\..\images\Connected Games Images\Week 11\image (6).png" style="width: 100%;">

            For logging in we simply check if the username inputted is even part of the database and for checking the password we get the salt that is already in the database and with the inputted password we will use the crypt() f
            unction and if that results in being the same as the hash that is already stored in the database then the check was successful and the player is logged in.
