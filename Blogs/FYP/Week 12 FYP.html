              <h2 class = "normal">Wave System</h2>
              <p>The deadline for the game is nearing so it was time to start finishing off my game, it was time to add one of the requirements of my game which was a wave system.</p>
              <p>I was able to create a wave system thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP2ozW0dLZ0&t=84s"> Matt Asplands</a> tutorial which helped me figure out how to go about counting the remaining enemies in UnreaI created a blueprint of type GameModeBase and named it "VR_GameMode" this is what will be starting the Enemy spawners and will be checking how many enemies are left in the game and so on. </p>
              <p>I first created a custom event called "CheckEnemyLeft" what this will do is check the amount of enemies left in the game and will do a bunch of checks to see whether or not a new wave will be spawned or if the game will be completed. If a new wave can be spawned then check if there are any enemies are alive, if there are no enemies alive that means all the enemies have been defeated so we then go into the next stage where the blueprint will then check if the wave the player is on is the last wave. </p>
              <p>If it is not the last wave then an event dispatcher will be called which will allow the blueprint to activate any functions that are binded to this event dispatcher, in this case the function that is binded to this dispatcher is a function inside a blueprint i created called "EnemySpawner" which will actually spawn in the Enemies.  If it is the last wave then a box (which will later be a portal) will be spawned into the arena where the player will then walk through to go back to the main lobby.</p>
              
              <h2 class = "normal">Enemy Spawner</h2>
              <p>The "EnemySpawner" blueprint does what you would expect it to do which is it spawns in the Enemy but in order to do that it needs to be able to communicate with the VR_Gamemode blueprint. This is where the event dispatcher from the VR_Gamemode blueprint comes in, first thing I had to do was bind the "SpawnEnemy" event which at the start disabled the "CanNextWaveSpawn" variable inside of the Vr_Gamemode blueprint making sure that another wave cannot spawn. </p>
              <p>Then a custom Loop was created where after every loop when an enemy spawns there will be a delay until the next enemies spawns. Once the loop is completed then the "CanNextWaveSpawn" variable will be set back to true meaning a new wave can spawn and then after the amount of enemies for the next wave will be set to be more than the last wave.</p>
