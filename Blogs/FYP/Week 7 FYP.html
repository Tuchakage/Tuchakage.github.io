              <h2 class = "normal">Im Back!</h2>
              <p>Its been awhile.... but I have finally completed all the assignments needed to be done allowing me to now focus on my VR game. Since the core of my game was pretty much done and was ready for the demo next week, i wanted to start on trying to implement full body immersion which is something that my tutor said they would love to see.</p>
              
              <h2 class = "normal">What I mean by Full Body Immersion?</h2>
              <p>Full body immersion is basically where i will have a character in my VR game, this sounds easy at first but thats only until you realise that the character model should move with the real life player. So when the real life player waves you should be able to see your character model wave, if the real life player crouches then the character models head should move down along with its body to make it look like its crouching.</p>

              <h2 class = "normal">How I Started Full Body Immersion</h2>
              <p>I started off using a method where the character is the parent of all the other VR components and then adding Arm IK so that the characters hands will follow the real life players hands.</p>
              <p>This was a good start to the project but i decide to discard all of that because i found a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBooEZnlAA4&t=1811s&ab_channel=KazVoeten">Kaz Voeten</a>] that showed me how to implement full body immersion into the Unreal Enigne.</p>

              <h2 class = "normal">Implementing Full Body</h2>
              <p>The way the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBooEZnlAA4&t=1811s&ab_channel=KazVoeten">tutorial</a> told me how to do it was to make it so the Skeletal mesh (The Player model) follows the VR origin using a few function, so i decided to create a new project to test this out. The guy also showed me how to make it so that if you move in real life with headset on then the character in game will also move with it which is basically done by a movement and rotation threshold and when you go pass these thresholds in real life then the character in game will move along with it.</p>
              <p>Now for the cool stuff, the Full Body IK. For this i just created Arm IK so that when you move the motion controllers in real life then your characters hands in game will move as well, i also added Head IK so that when the headset rotates in real life then so does the character head in game. </p>
              <p>I also have Leg IK which doesnt work like the Arm and Head IK, the purpose of the Leg IK is so that the the player character in the game can crouch whenever the VR headset goes further down than the original height which simulated crouching.</p>

              <h2 class = "normal">Conclusion</h2>
              <p>So i was able to follow the tutorial well and now my Full body IK was working but there is a few changes i need to make to put it into my actual project, the first one being was making it so that the body doesn't teleport to where the VR origin is when i move with the Track pad. </p>
              <p>For this problem i believe i will need to find the nodes that stops the teleporting and then make it so that the character Model will move with the VR origin by making it a parent of VR origin. I also need to make it so that the player can set their height so that if the player is too small there character wont automatically be crouching.</p>
              <p>I also need to get a better understanding of how this full body IK works because if im being honest i dont fully understand how it works and in order to get this into my main project and adapt it with my movement im going to need to understand most of whats happening in the Blueprints.</p>
