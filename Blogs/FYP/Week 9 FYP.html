              <h2 class = "normal">Discovering Anim Montages</h2>
              <p>I started to make the grab animation for the Character model but it wasn't as simple as when the player was just 2 invisible hand meshes. Since I cant just make a simple animation where its just the hand grabbing like how the original hand mesh did it, I needed a way where only the hand bones would move when playing the animation, this is when I discovered about Anim montages. </p>
              <p>Anim Montages makes it so that only certain bones are adjusted when an animation plays instead of the whole body doing the animation, in my case I just need the hand bones to move. </p>
              <p>I created the grab animation and just before I was about to add in the Anim Montage I realised I should actually make sure that I can grab with the Character model without the animation first.</p>
              
              <h2 class = "normal">Making It So The Player Can Grab</h2>
              <p>Since the motion controller components were originally in separate blueprints I had to convert it so that the component was inside the Blueprint for the VR Player along with the character mesh. Since the motion controller components for both the left and right hand are in the same blueprint now i made it so that the grabbing functions from the original hand blueprints were recreated for both the left hand and the right hand.</p>
              <p>After i did that the player character is now successfully able to grab the weapon the only thing left which i did was to create sockets on the character model so that the bow and dagger fit nicely into the hand but this only worked for one of the hands so far.....</p>
