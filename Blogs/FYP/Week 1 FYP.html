            <p>After finishing my Project Proposal and waiting for my loan request of the VR headset to be approved by the Uni, I HAVE FINALLY OBTAINED THE VR HEADSET! But when i got home after collecting the headset i realised i needed a stand for the motion trackers (Which i didnt know it came with this headset) so i had to wait a few days so i could go collect the stands and then get started with my Project.</p>
            <h2 class = "normal">Starting The Project!</h2>
            <p>Once i had gotten the stands for the Motion tracker i went straight into creating the Unreal Project. When i got into the VR world in Unreal i didnt like how to move around i have to teleport so, the first thing i implemented into my Game was the ability to move around using the track pad of the left controller so that i could easily get around the map. </p>
            <p>I also implemented rotating the camera left and right by using the trackpad on the right controller, this is so to look behind the player doesnt have to go through the effort of fully rotating especially since the Vive headset has a wire connected to it.</p>
            <p>The next feature i implemented was actually a lot more simpler than i thought and that was making a weapon fit into the players hand, all i needed to do was duplicate the already existing Pickup Cube Blueprint then edit the cube and then i had to set the location and rotation of the weapon (For now my weapon is just an elongated Cube).</p>
