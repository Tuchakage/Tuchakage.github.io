              <h2 class = "normal">Getting Used To The Plugin</h2>
              <p>So i tried to pick up the bow and arrow in VR but for some reason i couldnt pick it up but i could still pick up my dagger, this is when i realised that it is probably because my Character in the game is not setup to use the VRSlider Component from the VR Expansion plugin.</p>
              <p>On the <a href="https://vreue4.com/">website</a> where i got the VR plugin from there was an example Unreal project showcasing the different things that the plugin has to offer. This gave me an idea on how the plugin actually works, so i went back to my project and started to recreate the VR Character in the game.</p>
              <p>The way the VR Pawn Character was setup in the plugin is simpler than the original VR Pawn Character when it comes to spawning in the Motion controllers, this is because with the plugin version the Motion controllers they are already attached to the Player Blueprint whilst in the original version the Motion controllers are in a separate Blueprint that the Player has to spawn in when the game starts.</p>
              <p>I was able to get the VR Character to move around with the left track pad but for some reason it wouldnt rotate, thats when i found out that there is a "Set Actor Rotation VR" node which is much better than the "Set Actor Transform" node that i was using before. The only thing with this new node i found is that it was rotating way too fast where someone would actually get sick but all i had to do to fix that was uncheck the "Account for HMD Rotation" option on the node.</p>
              
              <h2 class = "normal">Final Thoughts On The Plugin</h2>
              <p>After recreating the VR Character i decided to revert back to the version of my project without the VR Expansion plugin, my reasoning for this is because i spent way too long trying to figure out how to use the VR expansion plugin when i barely know how to make a VR game without the plugin so i thought it would be best if i learn the basics instead of skipping straight to the hard stuff.</p>
