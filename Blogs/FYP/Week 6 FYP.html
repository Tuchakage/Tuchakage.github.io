              <h2 class = "normal">Player Taking Damage</h2>
              <p>Now it was the time to implement Enemies doing damage to the player but before getting started with this i looked at how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQGtrNr0vWM&ab_channel=VirtualRealityOasis">Gorn</a> dealt with player damage, seeing if they did any knockback to the player or any other kind of effects to indicate that the player took damage.</p>
              <p>They didn't have any knockback but they did have a red screen that appears for a while when they took damage. That is for something to add later on in the game for now i just wanted to make it so that the Enemy can actually do damage to the Player.</p>
              
              <h2 class = "normal">Blocking Enemy Attacks</h2>
              <p>I was able to figure out a way in my head to make it so that the Player can block Enemies attacks, my method of doing this was making it so that when the Enemy is attacking, if the Enemys attack box overlaps with any weapons with the tag "Can Block" then that means the Enemies attack will be blocked and the player wont lose health. To test if it was working i just made it so that when the Enemy attack is blocked then the Enemy will be one shot.</p>
              <p>Finally since the Enemy going towards the player and Enemy attacking the player is done, i decided to add the Enemy model with a walking, idle and attacking animation. The only animations i need to look for next is when the player hits the Enemy and when the Enemies attack gets blocked by the player.</p>
