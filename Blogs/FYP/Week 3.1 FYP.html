              <h2 class = "normal">Finally Being Able To Pick Up The Bow & Arrow!</h2>
              <p>After getting rid of the VR expansion plugin it was time to add in my Bow And Arrow the old fashioned way. I was able to make it so that you can finally pick up the bow and arrow but not only that, the bow and arrow can detect both of my hands, one hand to hold the bow and the other hand to pull the string (but for now the string is just a box collision).</p>
              
              <h2 class = "normal">Picking Up The Bow</h2>
              <p>The way this works is that it would first check if the Bow is already set to the first hand, if it is not then the Bow will be put into the Bow socket of the hand mesh and the hand that is picking up the bow at first will be stored within the Bow in the "FirstHand" variable. </p>
              <p>If the bow has already been set into the first hand then that means the bow is already in the hand, the Bow Blueprint will then check if the second hand is colliding with the string collison (which for now is the box collision) and then if the second is colliding with the string collision then the hand that is holding the string will be set into the "SecondHand" variable.</p>
              
              <h2 class = "normal">Dropping The Bow</h2>
              <p>When dropping the Bow it will first check if the Second hand has been released yet, if it hasnt been released yet then it will set the "SecondHand" variable to null which means nothing is holding the string collision. If the Second hand has been released already then it will go ahead and drop the bow from the first hand and set the "FirstHand" variable to null, it also makes sure that the "SecondHand" variable is empty</p>
              <p><b>Note:</b> For dropping the bow you just have to release the trigger on the motion controller and thats when the Event Drop node in the Blueprint will be triggered, the same goes for the Event Pickup node but you have to press on the trigger.</p>
