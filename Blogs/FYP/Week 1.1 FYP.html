              <h2 class = "normal">Trying Out C++ On Unreal For The First Time!</h2>
              <p>Now its time for me to explain the struggle i had............ Since it was my first time working with C++ i decided the first script i should make should be the health script, which just includes the players health and a function called <b>TakeDamage()</b> that has a parameter and whatever number is in the parameter is how much damage will be done to the player, that was the easy part.</p>
              <p>Then came trying to make to override the <b>OnComponentBeginOverlap</b> function in C++ in a new script i created for Weapons. The problem i kept having was that i kept getting an error message whenever i tried to override the <b>OnComponentBeginOverlap</b> function and the reason for that is because i was trying to do it to a class of type ActorComponent.</p>
              <p> I spent the whole day doing different methods of trying to get this to work and doing a lot of research, eventually i went to bed. Then when i woke up the next day an idea came to my mind that i somehow didnt think off for the previous day and that was making a variable of type CollisionMesh in the class of type ActorComponent and then overriding with that variable. I got out of bed, went on my Computer, tried the idea and i finally had no error messages.</p>
              <p>The next thing i had to do was assign the CollisionMesh to the variable in the editor at first i tried to do it in the <b>BeginPlay()</b> function but i was getting an error but all i had to do was put it in the <b>ConstructionScript</b> function which runs before the <b>BeginPlay()</b> function.</p>
              <p>Although i spent a whole day trying to do this one thing i wouldnt say it was a waste of a day because from me struggling on this i now had a much better understanding of C++ on Unreal than before.</p>
              <p>Now that i had the collision setup i was able to call the <b>TakeDamage()</b> Function that was in the previous health component script i made from the weapon component script i made whenever the player touches the weapon.</p>
