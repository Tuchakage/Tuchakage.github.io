            <h2 class = "normal">Getting Started On The Difficulty System</h2>
            <p>I wanted are game to be more enjoyable and challenging to play so i implemented different Difficultys. The way i went about this at first is that i made a DifficultyManager game object that cant be destroyed when it loads to a new scene and there will be a "difficulty" variable which can be set by pressing either the easy or medium button in the main menu. </p>
            <p>Depending on the button you press and when you load into one of the mini games, it would find the Game object that has the variable that is needed to be changed and it would change it for example, for the easy difficulty the conveyor speed would be set to 50 whilst for the medium difficulty the conveyor speed will be set to 150.</p>
            
            <h2 class = "normal">New Difficulty System</h2>
            <p>This was a nice and easy way to do Difficulty system but i figured out a way to make it so much more easier to set the variables that will change the difficulty for people who dont really understand code. I got this idea after having a look at how Hassan did the buttons for main menu, he was able to disable and enable the other buttons without any code and by just setting it on the button game object itself. </p>
            <p>This gave me an idea to see what would happen if i assigned a parameter to the function that the button would call and when i tried it and looked back at the inspector you were able to put any value in there that you want, the only thing is that you can not have more than 1 parameter.</p>
            <p>I made a public function with a parameter for each variable that needed to be changed to change the difficulty. So the process is when you click on the button, depending on what the number in the inspector is that value will be set to a static variable (In a new script called "DifficultySetter"), then once that has been set and you go to one of the mini games the DifficultyManager would then get that static variable and assign it to whatever it needs to be assigned to.</p>
