            <h2 class = "normal">Quick Little Improvements</h2>
            <p>In the Pause Menu that had already been created i added a restart button since it was one of the things our lecturer Hope said she would like to see in our game.</p>
            <p>We encountered a problem with the pause menu where if you press pause and then restart the level, the game will start off as paused and you had to press the pause button again and then press resume to fix it. To fix this problem i just added the UnPause() function in the Pause Script to the Start() function so that when the level resets it makes sure it is unpaused.</p>

            <h2 class = "normal">Making The Game Harder.....</h2>
            <p>So me and my team mates Shaafie and Hassan had a vote to see whether or not we get rid of the certain amount of items spawning feature that i added to get rid of the RNG aspect of the game. I wanted to keep it since i felt like the RNG was really annoying and long story short, i lost the vote and it was removed. </p>
            <p>Their reasoning for getting rid of it was because they felt like it would make the game harder and they suggested that we just speed up the conveyor belt and make items spawn faster which admittedly did make the RNG in the game a lot less annoying. </p>
            <p>To also make the game more fun and challenging i made it so that if you put the wrong ingredient into the wrong container then that container will lose an ingredient (so the variable it is supposed to be increasing to fill the container will instead decrease). This was very easy to implement, in the "container" script i just added an if statement to check if the variable we are trying to decrease is more than 0 and if it is then it will decrease the variable by 1 (Variable being decreased depends on the container that is using the "container" script). (Look At "Decreasing Ingredients" Image)</p>
            <p>To balance out the game a bit I made it so that if you put the correct item into  full container then the variable will not be increased but you will still gain time, the reason why i made it so that the variable wont increase is because then it means that if you put a wrong ingredient into that container which has a lot of the ingredients in then that container will still be full.</p>
