            <h2 class = "normal">Final Tweaks Before Publish</h2>
            <p>Before we published a new version of our game to get more feedback we quickly wanted to do a few things, the first thing was that there was a problem where if one of the container was full at one point in the game but then that container loses an ingredient because you put the wrong item in there. The game will still be completed if you completed all the other bowls, this is because i forgot to add the code that tells the game manager to decrease the amount of completed containers whenever a full container is no longer full.</p>
            <p>To also make our game look nice and fresh Shaafie created a an image for our buttons along with finding a font that would suit our game, i then added them to each game scene and then together we created a new main menu (See "Main Menu Update" down below).</p>
            <p>Before publishing i wanted to see what the game actually looked like on my Phone and not on the Unity Simulator which simulates mobile devices so i built the game for my phone and tested it out. When i looked at the game on my phone everything on the Canvas was all messed up and was much larger than it was on Unity, i went to go do some research on how to fix this problem with the canvas and i found out that my problem is solved if i set the UI Scale Mode of the canvas to Constant Physical size. Not only did it fit the UI Elements onto the canvas on my phone it also made it look better, after doing that i then made a new build version and published it.</p>
