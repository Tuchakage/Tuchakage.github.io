            <h2 class = "normal">The Feedback We Received From Our Teacher</h2>
            <p>Our Teacher Hope was able to play test our game and gave us some very valuable feedback.  She told us how we should make the conveyor belt for the first mini game move faster because rn it is too slow even for a beginner level. The next thing she told us to add was a restart button to start the level over again which is something that didnt cross my mind at all. </p>
            <p>The final thing she told us to add is to have a way of knowing when the containers are almost fall which we have the assets for but they have not been implemented yet. The new update of our game was then approved the next day after the feedback session but since Hope is an internal tester she could play the game straight away.</p>
            <h2 class = "normal">Our Response To The Feedback!</h2>
            <p>To be honest this week idecided to focus on our Multiplayer game for another module in time for the feedback session for that so i didn't really go on the project but i did create a checklist on our games Trello board so that we know what to do next.</p>
