            <h2 class = "normal">Sending Out The Game To Be Reviewed</h2>
            <p>I decided to check on the status of our game and i realised that there was another privacy section that needed to be completed to be published, luckily since our game is child friendly it was easy to complete and since it is so child friendly then it will be approved by Google quicker.</p>
            <p>Our current version of the game is just shapes that were used for testing but we were told by our lecturer Hope that it is best to try and publish our game with whatever we got now even if its not polished so that the game will be on the Google Play Store sooner rather than later.</p>
            <h2 class = "normal">New Things Added To Our Game!</h2>
            <p>Since in our game the items will be coming out of the conveyor belt randomly i needed to make a script that would randomly spawn in an item in the list. The only thing about this script i created is that it can just spawn in a bunch of the Milk game object and none of the flour game object which means it will be impossible for the player to win since they only have a set amount of time. I will fix this issue by making it so that only a certain amount of items can be spawned so that way every item can be spawned, this will be done in a later version of the game.</p>
            <p>Shaafie was able to finish creating quite a few assets in our game such as the container for the milk and an open and closed bin sprite. I added those assets into the game and then i made a small edit to the "Container" script  where if an item is hovering over the bin, it will turn from the bin closed sprite into the bin open sprite and then when the item is no longer hovering over then disable the bin open sprite.</p>
            <h2 class = "normal">Problem & Solution To Building The Game</h2>
            <p>I wanted to see what the APK of our game would look like on my phone and thats where i found out that the game doesn't fit on my phone which means it most likely didnt fit on every phone. For now i only made it to be the size of my phone which is a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge so i scaled the gameObject down and used the Simulator tab (A new window i found within Unity) which allows me to simulate my phone on my pc so i can easily see if it fits on my phone screen or not. </p>
            <p>I then encountered an error where all of a sudden i could no longer create a build version for the game, it took me a while to figure out the problem but i noticed the error was coming from something called il2cpp. So what i did was go to build settings then go to player settings and then change the scripting backend from il2cpp to Mono.            </p>
