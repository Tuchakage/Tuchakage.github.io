            <h2 class = "normal">Making It So Only A Certain Amount Of Items Spawn!</h2>
            <p>I decided to add a feature where only a certain amount of each item can spawn, the reason for adding this was combatting the issue where you get a certain amount of item spawning way too much (Look at "Item Spawning Too Much" Image).</p>
            <p>To do this I created a ItemCounter() function inside of the "ItemSpawner" script that will keep count of the different items that spawn, it has a parameter of type GameObject so that when an item is spawned, the item GameObject variable will be passed into the function and it will then compare the name of the GameObject with the name i have set it to look for.</p>
            <p>If there is a match between the name of the ingredient spawned and the name i have set then a variable is incremented, the variable incremented depends on what item was spawned e.g "goodmilk" variable will be incremented if a good milk game object is spawned.</p>
            <p>Once it is incremented it will check if the variable that was incremented  is equal to the max amount of items that can be spawned, if it is then remove the  ingredient from the list.</p>
            
            <h2 class = "normal">If You Make A Single Mistake, You Lose?!?!</h2>
            <p>After adding that feature in i realised that if you put in one of the ingredients into the wrong container, then there will be one container that cannot be full which means it will be impossible to complete the level. </p>
            <p>To fix this problem i created a function in the "ItemSpawner" script that would increase the spawn by first checking if the ingredient is still in the list.For example if the "goodmilk" variable (which goes up everytime a milk item is spawned) is equal to the amount of the "maxamntofitem" variable then that means the Ingredient has already been removed from the list, so i added code that will first load the ingredient from a resource folder then add it to the list.</p>
            <p>This function is called in the Container script whenever the player puts the item  into the wrong container, it is also called when the ingredients go outside of the screen.</p>
