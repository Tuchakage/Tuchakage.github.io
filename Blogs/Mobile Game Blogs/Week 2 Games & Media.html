            <p>Hassan couldn't make it into Uni today so me and Shaafie discussed the project with him via Discord. Today we started to think more about our game idea, this is where Shaafie then suggested that we should first focus on one mechanic to make and then showed us how we could make a game based off a mini game from a <a class ="bold" href="https://youtu.be/h1FKzGk80Bo?t=290">Mario DS game</a> where you have to put the correct colour bombs in the correct place.</p>
            <p>We then decided to scrap the donut based platformer idea and now we are making a game where the ingredients are coming out of the conveyor belt and we have to sort them into the right containers. We then created a Trello card where we would note down our game ideas and we managed to fill it up quite a bit and made good progress on what we want to game to be for example, we came up with a game idea where If you put the ingredients into the wrong container or you run out of time then you have to restart the level.</p>
            <p>We also decided to add mini games for after you finish sorting out the ingredients to fully complete the donut e.g having to roll the dough down the hill trying to avoid obstacles and adding sprinkles to your donut by shaking your phone.</p>
            <p>>We also came up with an idea to make the game harder by making it so that on some levels the conveyor belt will be faster than usual and on some levels we can make the containers start moving around in a circle so its harder to drop the ingredients into the right container.</p>
