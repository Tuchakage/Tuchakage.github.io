            <h2 class = "normal">Receiving Video Feedback</h2>
            <p>So our game got published and Shaafie was in a call with one of our friends on Discord and got him to screen share him playing the new version of our game, Shaafie was also recording the screen share so we could look back on it to decipher what we can improve, he also got the player to fill out our Google form.</p>
            
            <h2 class = "normal">Responding To Video Feedback</h2>
            <p>The first problem we found out was that in the Ingredients mini game when you are grabbing onto an ingredient but another ingredient is already falling that ingredient that is falling will just go through the container.</p>
            <p>At first we thought that this was a bug but then i realised that its actually the way the container script is setup. The way it is setup is that the Containers wont register any item that touches it if something is being dragged, so i had to make it so that instead of checking if something is being dragged in the whole scene i made it so that it will only check if the ingredient it has collided with is being dragged.</p>
            <p>After fixing that problem Shaafie pointed out how that them Items collide with each other so if you tried to drag an ingredient from one side of the game to the other side, the ingredients on the conveyor belt will be knocked off. To solve this problem i simply just added a line off code that called an IgnoreLayerCollision function and set it to ignore any Game object with the Ingredients layer.</p>   
            
            <h2 class = "normal">Making The Game Fit On All Screens</h2>
            <p>On our friends phone the Ingredients scene didnt fully fit, this problem with the game not fully fitting on different phone is the problem i have been having the whole project and now is the time to actually figure it out. The only thing i was able to find was a <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxwxZea0KAg&t=1s&ab_channel=AwesomeTuts">script online</a> that would give Game Objects anchor points, similar to the way UI elements have anchor points so that no matter the screen size they will stay the same.</p>
            <p>I added this script to all the game objects in the ingredients scene and then extended the background image and now the game fits on all phone sizes.</p>
