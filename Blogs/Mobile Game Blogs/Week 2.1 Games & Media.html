            <p>After finally coming up with a game idea that we were happy with it was time to start the project. To get the project started I created a new repositry on Github and added both Shaafie and Hassan (My Team mates) so that they can also make changes to the project.</p>
            <p>Since we are using Unity for our game i created the Unity project and the first thing I did was to setup both my phone and Unity so that when i press play on Unity the game will appear on my phone. After setting that up it was finally time to get started on the game, the first thing i implemented was the ability to drag and drop things using your fingers and to make sure it was working i used simple shapes such as a circle and 2 squares to make sure that when i hold my finger on a shape on the screen i can move it around and when i let go the shape drops.</p>
            <p>Since the basis of our game is to drag and drop the Donut ingredients into the right containers i started to work on a feature that knows if you put the right ingredients into the right container or the wrong ones into the wrong containers. Since the assets for our game wasn't ready i added colour to the shapes and then created 3 big circles one that was blue, one yellow and the other red to act as the containers. </p>
            <p>For this feature i made the containers collider a trigger and then created a script that was attached to the containers that would use the <b>OnTriggerStay2D()</b> function to detect the game object that has collided with them. Inside that function i created an if statement that will activate depending on which game object the script is on (see Collision pt 1 image). Then in those if statements depending on the colour of the game object that has been dropped onto the containers it will be the right or wrong one, whether its right or wrong the game object will still be destroyed when its dropped onto the container. When the assets are finished the shapes will be replaced with actual ingredients and containers.</p>
            <p>Since the core mechanic of the game was finished i started to work on adding a timer in the minutes and seconds format ({00:00}) to make our game truly feel like a game by making it so that when the timer runs out you lose the game.</p>
            <p>We made a group decision to set the timer to 2 minutes for now but this could be changed later on after some more play testing. I then implemented a feature where if you put the right object into the right container then you will get time added onto the timer and a small text will appear indicating you have got more time but i also added a feature for the opposite, if you put the wrong object into the wrong container then you will lose points and the game will tell you that you have lost points. </p>
            <p>I implemented this feature by making 2 functions one called <b>addTime()</b> and the other called <b>loseTime()</b> inside the GameManager script where when activated they will either add to the timer or take away time from the timer and it will also spawn the pop up text and the number that appears on the pop up text depends on the variables <b>addedtime</b> or <b>losttime</b> that was in the container Script. The 2 functions i just mentioned are called upon in the Container script which determines whether the item is correct or not.</p>
            <p>It took me a while to fully get this feature working because i had to make it so that the timer pop up text will appear infront of the container but i realised i just had to set the sorting order of the container to -1.</p>
