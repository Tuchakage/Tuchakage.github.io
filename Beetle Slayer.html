              <p class = "bold">Beetle Slayer is a 3D Turn Based RPG Game where you have to go through 3 different dungeons. In these dungeons you will have to fight against enemies to reach the Treasure chest at the end of the level that will give you a key. Once you gather the keys from all 3 dungeons then a portal will open up in the hub world where you will then need to fight the final boss to complete the game.</p>
              <p class="bold">Even though Beetle Slayer has Turn Based Combat there is also some combat outside of it, its only a simple attack that determines whether or not you will have an advantage when you start a battle with an enemy, the advantage being going first in battle no matter what. The way you activate this advantage is by sneaking behind the enemy and hitting them in the back, the player is also able to have a disadvantage at the start of the battle if the Enemy sneaks up on them without the Player attacking at all, the disadvantage being that the Enemy always goes first.  </p>
              <h5 class = "normal"> Controls:</h2>
              <p><b>Arrow Keys</b> – Movement </p>
              <p><b>Space Bar </b> – Jump </p>
              <p><b>Ranged Attack</b> – LCTRL (You can only used the ranged attack whilst standing still) </p>
              <p><b>F2 </b> – Restart the current level </p>
              <p><b>F3 </b> – Go to the next level once you have completed Level 1 </p>

              <h5 class = "normal">My Contribution:</h5>
              <p class = "bold">Since this was a Solo Project i did everything myself, from programming the mechanics to adding sprites other than the player such as enemies into the game and making them interactable. The only things i didnt do is make most of the sprites,the only sprites i made is the rock that you have to destroy and the tower you have to destroy, the other sprites are from the internet. </p>
