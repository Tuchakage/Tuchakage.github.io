            <h2 class = "normal">Starting The Rating System</h2>
            <p>I felt like the User should have a way to see how well they are doing in a mini game, so this is why i decided to get started on creating a Rating system where after each mini game (excluding Sprinkles because you cant lose in it) when the winning screen appears up to 3 stars will show up depending on how well the player did in that mini game.</p>
            <p>To add in Ratings into our game i had to first create a script and an empty game object that will not be destroyed on load which i called  "RatingManager". The RatingManager script will keep track of all the ratings the player gets from each mini game and it will display the stars after the end of each mini game.</p>
            
            
            <h2 class = "normal">How The Rating Manager Works</h2>
            <p>The First thing the RatingManager will do when it loads into a new scene is that it will try to find all the Stars on the Winning Screen and then once it has found all the stars it will then disable them, the purpose of this was just so it could find the stars it will need to re enable later.</p>
            <p>Once it has found the stars it will then disable the Win Screen so it is not visible until the mini game is finished, now it is time to talk about how the ratings will be stored. The ratings will be stored in a dictionary and then i created separate function for each mini game (Apart From Sprinkles Mini game) where they will calculate how to get each star and once the RatingManager figures out how many stars the player should get.</p>
            <p>Once that calculation is done depending on the mini game a new value will be added to the dictionary with a string (Being the name of the mini game) and an integer (Being the amount of stars the player got). After that there is another function that wil be called that will need to have a value of type integer passed into it and depending on the number passed into it, it will display the number of stars the player gets.</p>
