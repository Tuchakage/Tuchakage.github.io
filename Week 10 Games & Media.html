            <h2 class = "normal">Game Polish</h2>
            <p>Since we are nearing the deadline of this Project and we have made at least the core mechanics for the Mini games we wanted in our game, it was time to add in some assets and start polishing up the game.</p>
            <p>Shaafie created a few sprite assets such as the screen that shows up when you win/ Lose and created the a sprite for an open package and a closed packaged which i then imported to the Game. The package that the Donut for the Packing mini game will collide with looks very nice and clean, especially since Hassan added animation to the packages making them swing back and forth.</p>
            <p>Now the only sprite assets we need to finish all the mini games are the backgrounds for the Sprinkles and packing mini game and the sling shot for the packing mini game, but we didnt need them straight away.</p>
            
            <h2 class = "normal">Having Our Own Custom Music Created For Us!</h2>
            <p>We started to look for some sound effects and music but then i remembered how i got a friend who can make music. I asked him if he could make us some songs and he was down to do it, i gave him a list of sound effects and songs we would like and then all thats left to do was to wait. </p>
            <p>Quicker than expected he had already made all the sound effects and he made 2 songs for us to be used in our game, there was one more song that i wanted him to make but i didnt wanna take up all of his free time. There were a few sound effects that he couldnt make but since we weren't really putting in sound into our game just yet we left it for when we are almost finished.</p>
