            <h2 class = "normal">Finally Being Able To See Your Donut!</h2>
            <p>I remembered how Shaafie said earlier in the project that there should be a way the Player can fully see what their Donut looks like so that the sprinkles mini game was not a waste. I then decided to create a whole new scene where the Donut from the Sprinkles Scene would then be displayed and made to rotate, the way i get the Donut to the next scene is how i got the Donut to the Packing Mini game by using the Donut Manager.</p>
            <p>The only Problem with adding this new scene in is that for some reason the Donut in the Packing Mini Game will slowly start to move downwards, i tried triggering it many times but it only happens randomly so for now i just moved on to the next task instead of wasting anymore time.</p>

            <h2 class = "normal">Packing Mini Game, Completed</h2>
            <p>It was time to finish off the Packing Scene by adding a Winning condition and a Losing condition to the game. This wasnt very hard to implement since Hassan already added in the Score Manager so all i had to do was limit the amount of shots the player can take which i did by having the GameManager keep count of how many times the player shoots the Donut. I also made the Donut call a function within the GameManager that increments the amount of shots when the Donut has been released from the Slingshot.</p>
            <p>When the Player has taken all its shots then the game will end, if the players score is more than 1 then the winning screen will show up with the rating but if the player didn't hit any Donuts at all then the losing screen will show up. Now that the winning and losing conditions have been added to the Packing Mini game, that now means all the core gameplay of the mini games are now complete which means we can focus on making the game look better.</p>
