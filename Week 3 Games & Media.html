            <h2 class = "normal">Creating The Sprinkles Mini-Game</h2>


            <p>Since i had finished creating the basis of the game mechanics and split up the work between the 3 of us, i started to work on the sprinkles mini game.</p>
            <p>I decided to make snow using the particles systems on Unity because later on when the sprinkles assets are finished i can just replace the circles with sprinkles and they will just be falling down onto the donut.</p>
            <p>I noticed how when i shake my phone it would spawn in way too many sprinkles so to solve this solution i made the particle systems that spawns in the sprinkles only spawn in 2 sprinkles.</p>
            <h2 class = "normal">Figuring Out How To Get Sprinkles To Stick On Donut</h2>
            <p>Then after this came the hard part, i had to then figure out how i would get the sprinkles to stick onto the Donut, we had a team meeting where we all gave our ideas on how we would go about this. I suggested the idea of making the Donut rotate and then the sprinkles will just fall onto the Donut, Hassans idea was to make the sprinkles fall onto the Donut and then when enough sprinkles was on the Donut it will just turn into an image of a complete Donut and Shaafies idea was to put small colliders around the Donut and make only a certain amount of sprinkles in each collider.</p>
            <p>Long story short, we went with Shaafies idea because my suggestion would make the sprinkles on the Donut look unnatural and Hassans idea would kinda make the whole Spinkles Mini game pointless. At first i tried to get the sprinkles to stick on the Donut by using a onCollisionEnter() function but that didnt work and after some research about the particles system i found out that there is a collisions option on the particle system itself and i figured out that there is a OnParticleCollision function within Unity.</p>
            <p> After learning those new things i was able to make the sprinkles stick onto the Donut but there was a slight problem, once the sprinkles stuck onto the Donut the sprinkles would get smaller for some reason. To fix this problem i would have to save the scale of the sprinkles before i make it a child of the Donut Game Object (Thats how i stick the sprinkles onto the Donut) then after i make it a child of the Donut Game Object then i would reapply the scale that was saved.</p>
