              <p class="bold">To sabotage each other you can either punch your opponents off the stage, beat them up until they have no health left or you can grab hold of them which slows them down. Also to get to the finish line there will be a variety of obstacles.</p>
              <h5 class = "normal"> The Different Obstacle Courses:</h2>
              <p><b>Seesaw</b> –  Seesaw will tilt to the side your on resulting in you slipping off if you stay too long onto it. </p>

              <p><b>Conveyor Belts</b> – When you touch these conveyor belts you will be either forced to push through it if its going against you, or you can use it to your advantage if its pushing you forward.</p>

              <p><b>Moving platforms</b> – Make sure you time your jumps nicely or else you will miss the platforms completely since they are moving around.</p>
              <p><b>The Teleporter</b> – An obstacle course where you will be randomly teleported to proceed the course but you will either get a clean path or a path of mud that will slow you down.</p>
              <p><b>Jump and Slide</b> – There are obstacles that will try to slow you down and you must jump over some and slide under the others.</p>

              <h5 class = "normal">My Contribution:</h5>
              <p>In this project i was able to implement quite a lot of things. I was able to add in Enemy AI where they can sense the player and then chase after them using Unreal Engines Behaviour tree and EQS. I was also able to make it so that the Enemy AI can patrol around a platform whilst they haven't sensed a player yet and i made it so that once they are close enough to the player they sensed then they will punch the player which will knock the player backwards.</p>
              <p>I added in some simple combat into our game so that each players have their own health bar and they can attack each other, once their health is 0 then they will be knocked out for a few seconds. I was also able to help my team mates out in how we were going to get the Local multiplayer split screen working.</p>
              
              <h5 class = "normal">What I Learned</h5>
              <p>In this Project i was able to learn a lot of how Unreal Engine 4 works such as the features it has for AI (EQS & Behaviour Trees), how Blueprints work, how to setup character controls,etc. I also learned how important it is to have good communication with your team mates and making sure you get things done on time so you can spread the work out.</p>
