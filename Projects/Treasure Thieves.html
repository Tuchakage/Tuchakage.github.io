              <p class = "bold">Treasure Thieves is a team based PVP online multiplayer game where the players must steal the treasures from each others base and bring it back to their own base. In order to steal the treasure effectively, the player will need to protect the person who is holding the treasure by fighting off enemies or the holder of the treasure can just pass it around to other teammates which is risky since the enemy can come and intercept the pass.</p>
              
              <h5 class = "normal">My Contribution:</h5>
              <p>In This project since i was one of the Programmers i was able to implement a variety of things. Most of the things i did in this project was making it so that the online actually worked using the Photon Network, for example i was able to make it so that players can join each other and i also added in PVP.</p>
              <p>I also implemented the feature to pick up the Treasure and had to make sure that whilst the Treasure is being held by a player then another player cant take it out of their hands, the only way players can take treasures out of other players hands is to first attack them which causes them to drop the Treasure (Can only be done to the opposing team players).</p>
              <p>I was able to implement a respawn system for each player and i was also able to create cooldown bar where you can see how long until you can do your next attack.</p>
              
              <h5 class = "normal">What I Learned</h5>
              <p>This project was a very good learning experience for me because i was able to figure out how to make an Online multiplayer game. I learnt that its all about sending information over the server and making sure that for certain things such as a players health gets sent over to every player in the lobby.</p>
