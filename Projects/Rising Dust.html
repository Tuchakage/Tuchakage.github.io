              <p class = "bold">Rising Dust is a Cinematic Beat Em Up game about a boy's journey from 0 to Hero and the challenges he faces along the way that helps him mature and grow into the world's number 1</p>
              
              <h5 class = "normal">My Contribution:</h5>
              <p>My Role in this Project was <b>Scrum Leader</b>, so I would give team members tasks and make sure team members are doing their tasks on time and efficiently. I also organised and setup our Trello board and updated it throughout the project so that whenever a team member wasn’t sure what they should do for their tasks they can check the Product backlog which will tell them the individual things they will need to add in order to complete their tasks.</p>
              <p>I also contributed to Programming our game since it would give me something to do other than just giving team mates tasks. For Programming I did quite a lot such as, implementing the drag and drop mechanic, adding a feature where if you shake your phone sprinkles will spawn, moving the Donut that was created from one scene to another and more. When our designer created the assets for our game I also imported them into Unity and I was able to get one of my friends to create music and a few sound effects for our game.</p>
              <h5 class = "normal">What I Learned</h5>
              <p>Since i was the <b>Scrum Leader</b> in a team of 3 this project taught me how to effectively setup and use a Trello board with the Agile methodology. This project also taught me how to implement mechanics such as dragging & dropping on mobile and a mechanic that can detect when the player is shaking the phone, it also taught me the process of publishing a game to the Google Play Store</p>
              
              
              <h5 class = "normal"> Different Mini Games:</h2>

              <p><b>Roll A Dough Mini Game </b> – Swipe your screen up in an upwards motion to gain speed and get to the finish line quickly whilst also avoiding obstacles </p>
              <p><b>Sprinkles Mini Game</b> – Choose an Icing Flavour and then start shaking your phones within the time limit to get as much Sprinkles on your Donut as possible </p>
              <p><b>Packing Mini Game </b> – Drag & Shoot your Donut into the packages that are falling from the sky </p>
