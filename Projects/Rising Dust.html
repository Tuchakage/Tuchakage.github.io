              <h5 class = "normal">Platform: PC</h5>
              <p class = "bold">Rising Dust is a Cinematic Beat Em Up game about a boy's journey from 0 to Hero and the challenges he faces along the way that helps him mature and grow into the world's number 1</p>
              
              <h5 class = "normal">My Contribution:</h5>
              <p>My role in this project was <b>Captain/ Cinematics Programmer</b>, as the <b>Captain</b> I would allocate team
                members tasks and make sure they are doing them efficiently. I also organised and setup our Trello
                board and updated it throughout the project to make sure each team member knew what theyâ€™re
                next task is or what tasks were available that they could take on by checking the currents sprint
                backlogs which would tell them the task at hand in more detail.
              </p>
              <p>As the <b>Cinematics Programmer</b> I created all the cutscenes for our game by using a combination of
                the storyboard and script provided by both of our narrative designers and was able to contribute in adding voice lines to the cutscenes thanks to our audio
                engineer. I also contributed with some of the gameplay by creating the base
                blueprints for the Basic Enemy AI, one of the Enemies Ai fight in close range and the other will shoot
                an energy ball from a distance.</p>
              
              <h5 class = "normal">What I Learned</h5>
              <p>In this project I learnt a lot about not only the Unreal engine and creating cutscenes on them, but I
                was able to learn to a good degree about the process of creating the narrative game. As the captain I
                was able to dig into the narrative side, programmer side and audio side of game development but I
                was mostly the cinematics programmer, saying that I was able to learn about the process of first
                planning out the story. We were able to plan out the story quite easily by first using the Trello board
                to write down any ideas any team members had, once we had a hold of an idea then what was next
                was creating the world for the game.</p>
