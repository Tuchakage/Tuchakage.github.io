            <h5 class = "normal"> Solo Project </h5>
            <h5 class = "normal">Game Engine: Unreal Engine 4</h5>
            <h5 class = "normal">Platform: VR</h5>
            <p class = "bold">The Last Arena VR is a Single player VR Action game that will allow the player to fight with a range of different fighting styles. The player will be able to use a variety of different weapons to help them survive the waves of enemies that are out to get them in the arena. Each weapon will give the player a unique way of playing for example, the daggers will allow them to do decent damage and allow the player to escape enemies by teleporting to the dagger whilst the two handed sword gives them a good amount of damage and allows the player to block enemy attacks.</p>
          
          
            <h5 class = "normal">My Contribution:</h5>
            <p>Since this was a solo project all the programming was done by myself using the Unreal Engines blueprints mixed with a little bit of C++, all the models seen in the game were obtained from the internet.</p>
            
            <h5 class = "normal">What Did I Learn From This Project:</h5>
            <p>The Last Arena VR was a project that I decided to create to not only improve my understanding of the Unreal Engine but to also get some experience to creating a VR game. I was able to learn what is required to create a VR game for example, one of the features that I was extremely happy implement the full body immersion for that you will need to be able to modify the Ik of the head, foot and hands, you will also need to make sure that the character model will rotate with the VR Origin (VR Headset for the player) and need to make sure it moves with it.</p>
            <p>I was also able to find out about Blueprint interfaces and how they are important for communication between different blueprints without understanding this then it would have been extremely difficult to make the weapons be able to be picked up by the player.</p>
            <p>I believe one of the most important things that this project made me improve on is the skill to be able research things that isn’t really on the internet and then still being able to complete that task for example, there was very little on full body immersion and even though the implementation may not be the best there was I was still able to add it into my very first VR game.</p>
