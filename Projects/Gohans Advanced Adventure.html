            <p class = "bold">Gohans Advanced Adventure is a 2D Platform Beat Em Up based on the Game Boy Advanced game Dragon Ball: Advanced Adventure. The player must progress through the level by jumping to different platforms whilst beating up any enemies that get in their way. To get to the next level, the player must first collect all the Dragon Balls in the scene then destroy the tower at the end of each level.</p>
            <p class="bold">Once the player has completed all the levels there will be a boss battle at the end and if you successfully beat the boss, the game will be completed.</p>
           
            <h5 class = "normal">My Contribution:</h5>
            <p>Since this was a Solo Project i did everything myself, from programming the mechanics to adding sprites other than the player such as enemies into the game and making them interactable. The only things i didnt do is make most of the sprites,the only sprites i made is the rock that you have to destroy and the tower you have to destroy, the other sprites are from the internet. </p>
