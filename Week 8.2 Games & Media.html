            <h2 class = "normal">Containers Now Look Like They Are Being Filled Up!</h2>
            <p>Shaafie had finished all the container animation sprites for filling up the containers so i decided to work on that. We had a group discussion on how we should go about making the sprites of each of the containers change, Shaafie and Hassan suggested that we just make if statements that would change the sprite depending on the number of ingredients inside that container.</p>
            <p>That is an easy solution for now but later that would impact us and it would mean we cant change the value of the max amount of items for each bowl in other levels, so i suggested we did it by percentages to make it easier for us now and later which they then agreed with. (Look at "Changing Container Sprites" Image).</p>
            
            <h2 class = "normal">Improving Sprinkles Scene</h2>
            <p>The assets to make the sprinkles mini game better than ever were ready, these assets included a plain Donut, Donuts with different type of icing, different icing droplets, an Icing machine along with buttons for the Icing machine and finally the sprinkles.</p>
            <p>Once i had put all the assets in place i worked on the buttons for the icing machine. This was simple since i made the button sprites actual buttons, so all i had to was create a new script which i called "FrostingMachine" made it hold a list of all the icing game objects and depending on the button you press that icing will be spawned.</p>
            <p>Next was adding Icing to the Donut, for this i just made a script on the Donut where depending on the icing it collides with the sprite of the Donut will change. Now it was time to change the square particles into actual sprinkles.</p>
            <p>Since Shaafie created different sprinkle shapes i made a script that when a sprinkle was spawned in each sprinkle will be different not only by shape but by colour as well. This just uses a simple script where it will randomly choose a sprinkle and colour by picking a random number between 0 and the max amount of items in that list. I also had to create a function that would scale the size of the sprinkle to be appropriate depending on the Sprinkle shape that was spawned.</p>
            <p>The last thing i did to the Sprinkles Scene was make it so that after the Donut has icing on it, the Icing Machine will dissapear and a 10 second timer will show up meaning you have 10 seconds to get as many sprinkles onto your Donut as you can.</p>
