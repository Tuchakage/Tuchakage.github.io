            <h2 class = "normal">Converting Sprinkles From Particles To Game Object</h2>
            <p>So the Donut was shooting fine and everything was scaled correctly, apart from the Sprinkles. After some research i found out there is a way to make the particles from the particle system scale with its parent game object, for this all i had to do was change the scaling mode from local to hierarchy and then got rid of the lines of code in the IcingCollision script that would change the local scale of the sprinkles when they touch the colliders that stick them onto the Donuts.  </p>
            <p>The scaling was fixed but there was just one more problem, when the Next Donut was spawned in the particle system would reset and the sprinkles will come falling down again defeating the whole purpose of the Sprinkles mini game. After that i made the decision to just make the Sprinkles a Game object instead of a particle system and that decision made everything so much easier.</p>
            
            <h2 class = "normal">Small Collision Between Donut And Package</h2>
            <p>I added a collision to a floating circle (which is for now the package that the Donut will be going into) so that when you shoot the Donut and it collides with the Package it will make the Package fall down faster and there will be an Enumerator that will be called which will respawn another Donut after a small wait which will allow the player to just watch the package fall.</p>
