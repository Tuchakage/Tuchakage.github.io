            <p>Quicker than i thought, our game has been published to the Google Play Store! But since next week is when the Feedback session is happening i decided we should publish the new version of the game we had once i added the things i wanted to do, but before that i added Hope and my team mates as an Internal Tester so that we would all get the update instantly.</p>
            <h2 class = "normal">Finishing Off The New Version Of Our Game!</h2>
            <p>For our game we needed a way so that too many of the same item doesnt come out of the Conveyor belt for example, if the milk item keeps spawning due to bad luck then it will just make the game an annoying luck based game which is not what we want. The items going down the Conveyor belt were going way too fast for the beginner level so i changed the speed value so its much slower.</p>
            <p>The last thing i changed before making a build version was changing the mini games that you could select from the main menu to play, before it was the roll a ball mini game but there wasn't much in there to be honest so i changed it to the sprinkler game since its pretty much finished we just need the assets to make it fit our game.</p>
            <p>After doing that i built the game, tested it out on my phone and it was working fine. Then we uploaded the new version to the Google Play Store and we just had to wait for the game to be approved.            </p>
