            <h2 class = "normal">Pausing In Packing Mini Game</h2>
            <p>There was a problem where the Ratings would show for one level but then in the next level it wouldn't show, i found out that the reason for this is because in the list, the first 3 elements are supposed to be the 3 star images in the scene, but instead the first 3 game objects were missing game objects.</p>
            <p>So I made a function called "ClearList" that will basically reset the list so that when the rating Manager looks for the stars again they will be the first 3 elements.</p>
            
            <h2 class = "normal">Problems With Stars Not Showing Up</h2>
            <p>It was time to finish off the Packing Scene by adding a Winning condition and a Losing condition to the game. This wasnt very hard to implement since Hassan already added in the Score Manager so all i had to do was limit the amount of shots the player can take which i did by having the GameManager keep count of how many times the player shoots the Donut. I also made the Donut call a function within the GameManager that increments the amount of shots when the Donut has been released from the Slingshot.</p>
            <p>When the Player has taken all its shots then the game will end, if the players score is more than 1 then the winning screen will show up with the rating but if the player didn't hit any Donuts at all then the losing screen will show up. Now that the winning and losing conditions have been added to the Packing Mini game, that now means all the core gameplay of the mini games are now complete which means we can focus on making the game look better.</p>
